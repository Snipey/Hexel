The roots are plentiful, if not varied; and, thanks to that Hikmalat outcropping I passed yesterday, they are particularly nourishing. I guess all those hours poring over dusty books, learning which plants are safe to eat and where they grow, actually proved useful. Thank the Gift: I won't starve.\n\nCould do with some more flavor, though. I'll say that, though all my old scholarly friends will mock me mercilessly when they read this.\n\nIf they read this.\n\nIt was your idea, they'll say. You could be snug at the temple, enjoying three square meals with an abundance of color and flavor, and sleep tonight in a soft bed knowing that you have spent that day in the noble pursuit of learning. But no, and here's where they'll wave whatever book they're holding in my face, dust rippling from its pages and shimmering in stray shafts of sunlight, you had to see if the rumors were true. Wisdom and knowledge weren't enough for your ambition. You had to go seek another kind of temple. And you didn\u2019t even pack enough food!\n\nThey\u2019ll be right, of course, when they give me this speech\u2014when I see them again.\n\nIf I see anyone again.\n\nBut I\u2019m right too\u2014by almighty Hikma, I swear I\u2019m right. Those pilgrims who passed through last season couldn\u2019t have been lying. They said they\u2019d seen it: a temple just like ours, but devoted to story\u2014to song\u2014to beauty. Far away, of course . . . across the mountains, at the edge of the desert . . . but there. It exists.\n\nAnd I belong there. I\u2019ve always known the scholarly life wasn\u2019t for me. I couldn\u2019t even keep a proper account of my days without weaving in tales\u2014snatches of song\u2014the odd sketch. Even in the driest, dustiest academic tome, I saw echoes of color . . . felt the frigid breath of ancient snowstorms . . . heard ghosts of tunes sung over old, forgotten campfires. I knew THAT knowledge was my vocation\u2014my destiny\u2014my true home.\n\nLook at me now: still keeping this Hikma-blasted journal, according to scholarly training, but waxing eloquent about dreams and destiny and old campfires. I don\u2019t belong back there. I belong . . . ahead. Somewhere.\n\nWish I had one of those campfires here now, though. Or at least that I\u2019d had the chance to practice building a fire, instead of just reading about it.\n\nI bet these roots would taste better cooked."

I could still sing it now\u2014play it, too, if the\n\nroom would just stop spinning for one gifted moment. But the scroll, with the words and notes\u2014the one I jotted down for my own personal use, and only showed to him once he was\n\ncrying so hard my head hurt . . . or maybe he was laughing. Was I laughing? That sounds right; we were singing, and laughing, and crying, and then . . . I woke up, and the scroll\n\nwas gone.\n\nSo he stole it . . . didn\u2019t he?\n\nIt\u2019s all muddy and swirling in my memory\u2014but that\u2019s why I\u2019m here. Melly always says: \u201cWrite it down, sort it out!\u201d So, I\u2019m writing . . . though the light is so bright on the paper,\n\nand the letters are all jumping around like they\u2019re a jig come to life, and the words are bouncing around to the same tune in my head . . .\n\nA tune. That\u2019s what started it.\n\nHe heard me before I saw him\u2014said he did, anyway. Heard me whistling my new song as I was walking home, and caught up to me right outside the pub. \u201cJust passin\u2019 through,\u201d he said,\n\n\u201ccollectin\u2019 tales and tunes as I go. Shall we trade a few, and share some drinks into the bargain?\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t look evil\u2014a tad unusual, but that\u2019s to be expected with strangers. Tiny fella, but with a smile and a spirit big as a house. We don\u2019t get too many newcomers, and precious\n\nlittle of new tales or tunes. A drink and a few stories sounded mighty fine, and I said as much, so into the pub we went.\n\nIt\u2019s coming clear now\u2014sorting itself out, just like Melly said it would. He didn\u2019t ask for my tune straight out; he laid the trap all sweet and sunny, singing and playing songs and\n\nstories from places I\u2019ve never heard of. But I saw them all last night\u2014saw them, heard them, and felt myself there. That\u2019s the main picture I can\u2019t get out of my mind: that little\n\nfella, perched on the bench, wailing away on that lute like it was part of him, weaving us all into his spell.\n\nThen he asked me to share my tune, and it seemed only fitting to invite him back here, where I could play and sing in the comfort of home. No idea what time it was, though Melly\n\nseemed pretty put-out when we showed up at the door\u2014I\u2019ll get an earful about that today, for sure. I played my song, and he was surely the best listener I\u2019ve ever had; he asked for\n\nit again, and played along this time, and then we played and sang it together, over and over. I felt right close to this little fella; he seemed to understand the song even better\n\nthan I did.\n\nNext thing I knew, I was showing him my song-scrolls. I even showed him my great-great-great grandpa\u2019s journals: records of one of the first Song Sanctuaries ever built, back when\n\nthe Gift was mostly just used for learning.\n\nMighty precious, those journals\u2014but he didn\u2019t take them. He just took the song. I\u2019m starting to remember . . . he did ask for it. Said he was collecting songs from all over, and\n\nkeeping a record for future generations, long after we\u2019re all dead and gone . . . some high-minded mission or other. I said no, of course . . . or was it maybe? Or did I just fall\n\nasleep?\n\nNo matter: that silver-tongued traveler stole my song, and he\u2019s gonna give it to all them future generations.\n\nMelly\u2019s gonna have my hide."

Surely the Great Star is but the first to arrive\u2014more will come, and when they do, we must be ready. For they are coming to take the faithful\n\nback to the skies: those who have always followed the stars will ascend to the heavens, and live among their divine kin forever.\n\nSo we must go to meet the Great Star. We must learn what preparations are required, and take the tidings\u2014and the charted course\u2014back to our people. But how can we find the way when\n\nour ancient heavenly map has veiled itself in clouds and storms?\n\nIt is not like me to be afraid. I am an experienced sea voyager; that is why they chose me. Me, and my young son\u2014not young any more, practically a man\u2014for we have ventured farther\n\nthrough these waters than any dare to go, and we always return. Even after the seas claimed my husband, we kept sailing.\n\n\u201cHow can you bear it?\u201d my people asked, at the start of each new voyage. \u201cHow can you trust yourself to the sea when it has taken so much from you?\u201d I could not speak, but my son\n\nsmiled\u2014his father\u2019s smile\u2014and gave his father\u2019s old reply: \u201cThe sea is treacherous; but the stars are ever faithful, and they will always lead us home.\u201d\n\nI know the stars will lead us. We are out farther now than ever before, but though the shape of the stars may change, their song remains constant. I hear my husband\u2019s spirit\u2014hear\n\nhis whispers, even amidst the crashing of the waves and the howling of the storm. I hear his heart in my son\u2019s voice as he comforts me.\n\nWe always knew our boy is special: he not only sees the stars, but hears them, and speaks to them. \u201cI hear them still, Mother,\u201d he says, with that smile bright enough to light our\n\nway through the dark. \u201cThey are speaking; they are singing; they will guide us to the Great Star that has fallen. Such a gift could not be given in vain.\u201d\n\nI believe him. I know the stars will lead us. So great a gift would not simply abandon us to vanish beneath the waves.\n\nI know the stars hear him. I know they see me.\n\nI only wish I could see them tonight."

Even with the improved communication among our various facilities, it is madness to think we could ever record all of our findings accurately and comprehensibly. Our\n\nbrains simply aren\u2019t designed for it (to say nothing of our hands; mine cramp every night from hours and hours of frantic scribbling).\n\nOh, how I wish I lived all those generations ago, when the tool first appeared. If our records\u2014not to mention my own family history\u2014are to be believed, the people saw it as a gift\n\nfrom the gods: to be worshiped and revered, not used or analyzed. My scholarly habits compel me to provide two logical reasons for such a backward-thinking wish: first, composing\n\nhymns in praise of the tool sounds much simpler and more relaxing than cataloging its multitudinous plethora of uses; second, I\u2019d like to give those gods a piece of my mind for\n\nsending such a gift without better instructions.\n\nBut I don\u2019t dare voice these desires anywhere but this journal. Ever since great-great-great uncle . . . . Marcus? Possibly? Never could get a definitive confirmation from\n\nGrandfather about that being his name\u2014ran off to help found the first artistic facility, our family has been under constant scrutiny for being untrustworthy, or\u2014GASP!\u2014unscholarly.\n\nNever mind that he succeeded, and those facilities are now flourishing all over the world, in exquisite harmony with our centers of learning; no, all the people around here can\n\nfocus on is his unmitigated gall. Who in their right mind would prefer sketching and singing to STUDYING?\n\nSometimes, I feel a deep kinship with great-great-great uncle Possibly-Marcus.\n\nIf only this work could feel more like a song\u2014or better yet, a conversation. If only the gods had sent not only the gift, but other beings along with it\u2014some form of life clever\n\nenough to record all of this information, yet not so clever that they\u2019d misuse the tool or wander off to use it for their own ends . . .\n\nIf only the wisdom we\u2019ve gained from the tool could inspire us to invent such beings ourselves . . .\n\nIf only . . .\n\nI must away, journal of mine. I feel the spirit of great-great-great uncle Possibly-Marcus moving within me\u2014but this time, I think the results may prove more academically useful\n\nthan any of my ancestors (or colleagues, hopefully) could dream"

However, these places require significant effort to maintain. It often takes a group of players working together to manage the daily upkeep and growth of the Settlement.\n\nStarting your own Settlement is a difficult task that may require help from others.
